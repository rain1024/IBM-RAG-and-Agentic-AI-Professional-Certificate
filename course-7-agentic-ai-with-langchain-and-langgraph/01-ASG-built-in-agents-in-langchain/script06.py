DESCRIPTION:
    This module provides a demonstration for configuring and setting up
    IBM's WatsonxLLM using the LangChain framework. Shows how to initialize
    the WatsonxLLM with proper parameters and configuration settings.
    
    Note: This is for demonstration purposes only as I don't have the actual
    API key/credentials to connect to WatsonxLLM. To use in production,
    you would need valid IBM Cloud credentials and project ID.

from langchain_ibm import WatsonxLLM

# Note: 'parameters' variable is expected to be defined elsewhere
# This is a demonstration setup - actual credentials would be needed
